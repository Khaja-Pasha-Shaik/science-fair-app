    "projectDescription": "After the valuable lessons learned from the Chandrayaan 2 mission, ISRO has meticulously planned Chandrayaan 3 to ensure an even more successful lunar exploration venture. The mission includes significant improvements in engineering and technology to address the challenges faced during the earlier missions.One of the primary objectives of Chandrayaan 3 is to land a rover on the lunar surface, equipped with advanced instruments to analyze the composition of the regolith and search for traces of water and other elements. Additionally, the mission aims to deploy a lander that will act as a communication relay between the rover and the Earth, facilitating the transmission of valuable scientific data.",

    "projectDescription": "A lunar eclipse is a celestial event where the Earth comes between the Sun and the Moon, causing the Earth's shadow to fall on the Moon. During a lunar eclipse, the Moon may appear to turn dark or change color, often taking on a reddish hue, giving it the nickname Blood Moon. Unlike a solar eclipse, a lunar eclipse is safe to watch with the naked eye. It's a fascinating natural occurrence that reminds us of the intricate dance between the Earth, Moon, and Sun in our vast universe.Lunar eclipses can be observed from various parts of the world, making them accessible to people across different regions.",
